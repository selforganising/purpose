# Our purpose

**What is our purpose?**  
To create *sustainable* learning and work environments that are *accessible to all*.

**How are we *sustainable*?**  
By being self-supporting through the efforts of our members.

**Who are our *members*?**  
Those with a demonstrable *commitment* to our purpose.

**How do members demonstrate *commitment*?**  
By contributing their time or resources to helping us realise our purpose (and by having done so for a period of not less than 12 months).

**What do we mean by *accessible to all*?**  
That nobody who *wishes to learn* is excluded from the opportunity to do so through lack of resources.

**How do we learn?**  
Largely in collaboration with our peers and by *helping others to learn*.

**How is our space organised?**  
In 4 connected parts:

1. A co-working space for members and mentors.
2. A classroom for students.
3. An open study space for the general public.
4. A dining space where people can meet and share food.

**How do we *help others to learn*?**  
By *mentoring* others and by creating *learning materials*.

**What sort of *learning materials* do we create?**  
We create [*patterns*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language) of knowledge, after the work of Chistopher Alexander, [*A Pattern Language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language).
